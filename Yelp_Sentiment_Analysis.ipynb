We went on a Sunday afternoon (prime brunch time) and the place was packed. I was a little overwhelmed with putting our name in and trying to grab a drink while we waited. It was around a 45 minute wait....long but worth it. I sipped on a house mimosa, which is amazing. Hand-pressed OJ made it. We were seated at the large communal table in the center of the place. At first I was like oh geez this is going to be awkward (I've had not such good experiences with communal seating). Right off the bat the guys across from us started a lively conversation. They recommended I get the grilled cheese, which I did. Turned out the fellows across the way were from the same area as I grew up on the east coast, small world! \nFood came quickly. Was delicious, as expected! Communal seating wasn't as awkward as I expected. Decor is really trendy.",

They even made an accommodation when I told them he gets stressed around other dogs, to bring him when they had fewer pups around. They called me as soon as they were done so he was only there a couple of hours. When I arrived to pick him up, he was hanging out under the desk near one of the ladies. Everyone was very gentle with him and he seemed very happy with his new haircut. His trim looked good, his coat was soft and he had a little kerchief around his neck. I saw a couple of other groomed dogs who also looked good. Price was very reasonable with $5 off coupon. Ease in making appt was exceptional. All in all, excellent experience. Highly recommend.",

I love how rustic it is. The seating may not be the most comfortable because it's bench-like but it's very spacious. The menu is very limited compare to other Korean restaurants but i don't really mind for the fact that they do it right with the dishes they offer. I usually order the BBQ chicken and the soft tofu mushroom soup. I think I've tried almost all their soups but i always manage to go back to the simple mushroom one. It's so delicious, from the broth to the soft tofu and aroma of the shitake mushroom. The added bonus to ordering the soup would be the level of spiciness that you can choose from. I always go with medium because the \"more spicy\" is really overwhelming after a few spoonfuls and it's kind of hard to enjoy the true flavor of the broth when your month is burning.",

It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who'd never been there before and didn't know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed.

I love how rustic it is. The seating may not be the most comfortable because it's bench-like but it's very spacious. The menu is very limited compare to other Korean restaurants but i don't really mind for the fact that they do it right with the dishes they offer. I usually order the BBQ chicken and the soft tofu mushroom soup. I think I've tried almost all their soups but i always manage to go back to the simple mushroom one. It's so delicious, from the broth to the soft tofu and aroma of the shitake mushroom. The added bonus to ordering the soup would be the level of spiciness that you can choose from. I always go with medium because the \"more spicy\" is really overwhelming after a few spoonfuls and it's kind of hard to enjoy the true flavor of the broth when your month is burning.",

There was only 1 waitress serving the entire sushi side which has about 6-8 tables and a large sushi bar. All seats were full. The waitress was doing the absolute best she could under the circumstances but of course, service was lacking. It took several minutes to receive simple requests like a napkin or side of sauce and sometimes she forgot about it all together. \nFood was great so we returned the following Friday (last night) with some friends. We sat on hibachi side this time. Everything was pretty good until towards the end of our meal. As we were served each part of the meal it seemed like the portion size got smaller and smaller. The last two parts were noodles and vegetables. Noodles portion was very small. I would say it was a quarter of what you get at Kobe's. Then came the vegetables. I'm not sure about the rest of the people on the other side of us, but our vegetables were almost non existent. My 2 friends both ordered an extra side of veggies for $4 each in additon to what comes with the meal. I would say they got a normal portion that should already come with the meal. Then my friend to the left of me received about 4 pcs of veggies. 4 PIECES! After the tiny noodles portion and then this, we were very unhappy. The chef had to have known he screwed something up, but he went on like nothing happened. There are no managers walking around talking to customers and checking if the meal was ok. \nFood is very good, but they just don't have it all together. They spent a lot of time and money on the beautiful decorations but it seems like customer service is not a concern. \n\nStep it up kuchi!!! We would love to return but we are fearful.",
